tour.py - an interactive learning tour of this automation kit
==============================================================
Run it with:

    python tour.py

No arguments, no setup beyond the kit's own install steps. The tour is a
menu of short chapters. Read a little, then WATCH a real browser do the
work - every "watch" chapter opens Chromium in slow motion so you can see
exactly what the test script is doing, step by step.

Chapters can be taken in any order, but first-timers should just go 1-2-3...

        CHAPTER 1 - WHAT IS THIS KIT?

        Test automation means writing a program that uses a website the
        way a person would - clicking buttons, filling forms, reading the
        page - and CHECKS that the site behaves correctly. Instead of a
        human re-testing everything after each change, the scripts do it
        in minutes.

        This kit tests a site built exactly for practicing:
        https://automationexercise.com. It publishes 26 official test
        cases, and this kit implements every one of them with Playwright
        (the tool that drives the browser) and pytest (the tool that runs
        tests and reports results).

        Your map of the kit:

          learn/            the 26 practice tests (the pristine source)
          tour-tests/       YOUR copy of them - edit and break freely
          pages/            "page objects" - one class per page of the site
          helpers/          user journeys like create_account()
          pytest.ini        settings applied to every run
          run_tests.py      run everything + build a graphical report
          scaffold.py       create a test project for YOUR own app
          README.md         the written version of this tour

        walks through a full user registration one commented step at a
        time. But before reading anything, take Chapter 2 and WATCH a
        test run. It makes everything else click.

        tour-tests/test_tc09_search_product.py, slowed down (500 ms between
        actions) so your eyes can follow.

        Watch for these moments:

          1. The home page opens (and a cookie popup gets dismissed)
          2. It clicks 'Products' in the menu
          3. It types "dress" into the search box and hits the button
          4. It CHECKS the results - every product shown must actually
             be a dress. That check is the entire point of a test.

        The window closes on its own when the test finishes.

def chapter_locators():
    say("""
        CHAPTER 3 - LOCATORS: HOW TESTS FIND THINGS ON A PAGE

        Before a script can click a button, it must FIND the button.
        The finding recipe is called a locator. The golden rule: locate
        things the way a USER would describe them, not by their position.

        The kit uses these, from best to most technical:

          page.get_by_role("link", name="Products")
              "the link that says Products" - how a user thinks. Survives
              redesigns as long as the link still says Products.

          page.get_by_text("Account Created!")
              "wherever it says Account Created!" - great for checking
              that a message appeared.

          page.locator("#search_product")
              CSS id. Precise but technical - the id can change even
              when the page looks identical.

          page.locator('input[data-qa="login-email"]')
              An attribute developers add SPECIFICALLY for tests. When a
              site offers these (this one does), use them - they are a
              promise that tests may rely on them.

        And the check side - every test ends with an expectation:

          expect(page.get_by_text("Logged in as Bob")).to_be_visible()

        expect() WAITS (up to a timeout) for the condition to come true.
        That patience is why Playwright tests never need sleep() calls
        sprinkled around - and unexplained sleeps are the #1 smell in
        beginner test code.

        See them in action: the page classes in the pages/ folder use
        all four styles, with comments saying why each was chosen.

        CHAPTER 4 - RECORD A SCRIPT BY CLICKING (CODEGEN)

        Playwright has a magic trick: it can WATCH YOU use a site and
        WRITE THE CODE for you. Two windows will open - the website, and
        an inspector that fills with Python as you click.

        Try this while it runs:

          1. Click around: open Products, search for something, view an
             item. Watch a line of code appear for every action.
          2. Hover anything - codegen shows the locator it would use,
             teaching you Chapter 3 interactively.
          3. Copy the generated code from the inspector window if you
             want to keep it (it makes a great skeleton for a test).

        Recorded code is a starting point, not a finished test: it has
        clicks but no CHECKS. A real test adds expect() lines - the
        difference between "do stuff" and "verify the site works".

        Close both windows when you're done to come back to the menu.
