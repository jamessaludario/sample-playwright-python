"""
Test Case 23: Verify address details in checkout page
=====================================================
When you registered, you typed in your address. This test checks the
checkout page shows EXACTLY that address back to you — both as the
delivery address and the billing (invoice) address.

This is why conftest.py keeps the account details in one shared
ACCOUNT dictionary: the same data used to FILL the form is used
here to CHECK the result. If we typed it twice, a typo in one place
would make the test lie to us.
