Test Case 20: Search Products and Verify Cart After Login
=========================================================
A clever test: we search for products as a GUEST, add them all to
the cart, then LOG IN — and check the cart kept our products.
(Websites often lose the guest cart on login; this verifies the
site does it right.)

New idea in this test:
  - A for-loop: we call add_product_to_cart() once for each search
    result to add them all, one by one.
