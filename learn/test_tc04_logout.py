"""
Test Case 4: Logout User
========================
We log in, then log out, and verify we land back on the login page.

Like Test Case 2, we first create our own throwaway account so the
test does not depend on anything existing beforehand. A test that
prepares everything it needs is called "self-contained" — it can run
on its own, in any order, on any machine.
