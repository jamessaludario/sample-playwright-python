"""
desktop/run_tests.py
=====================
Running the desktop tests directly with pytest means remembering two
flags every time (see desktop/tests/test_calculator.py for why:
--confcutdir keeps the web track's browser fixtures out of these tests,
--reruns 0 turns off the web track's retry-on-failure). This script
bakes both in, the way run_tests.py (repo root) bakes in the Allure
report steps for the web track.

Usage (anything you'd normally give pytest just goes on the end):

  python desktop/run_tests.py                            # everything
  python desktop/run_tests.py -k "add"                   # matching tests
  python desktop/run_tests.py desktop/tests/test_calculator.py

    #
    # Checking .exists() (not just "doesn't start with -") matters because
    # some flags take a bare value of their own, like -k "add" - "add"

    # default and let pytest fall back to its own testpaths (tour-tests).
